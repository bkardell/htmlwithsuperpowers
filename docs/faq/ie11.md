# Do Web Components work with IE11?

**Short Answer: Yes**, through a polyfill. Google created and maintains [`webcomponents/polyfills`](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills) so it should work, but with porting features back to old browsers, your mileage may vary.

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Worth noting: **IE11 support ended June 15th, 2022** ([source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/internet-explorer-11-end-of-support))

::: tip
Due to the progressive enhancement superpower :sparkles:  nature of Web Components, you may be able to structure your site in a way to not need a polyfill. Depends on your situation, but un-enhanced LightDOM may be able to provide a suitable fallback.
