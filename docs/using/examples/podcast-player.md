# `<podcast-player>`

I have strong opinions on what makes for a Good Podcast Player:tm:, so I built a Web Component to add all the features I want around a native `<audio>` element.

```html
<podcast-player>
	<audio src="path/to/my.mp3" controls></audio>
</podcast-player>

<script type="module" src="path/to/podcast-player.js"></script>
```
