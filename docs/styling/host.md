# `:host` pseudo-class

Templates and Slots bring with them a handful of CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to help with styling.

The `:host` pseudo-class is a reference to the custom element itself, but you're unable   `:root` pseudo-class in HTML. 

```css
:host p {
  background: orange;
}

:host > div {
  background: pink;
}
```
